== Main concepts of PCW

*ProActive Cloud Watch (PCW)* monitors a system, and according to some rules, detects complex events, and trigger actions when configured events are fired. +
PCW defines *rules*, which describe the metrics to monitor, triggering conditions and action when the conditions are met. +

ProActive Cloud Watch is organized as a catalog of rules (which can be activated or deactivated) that will automatically trigger user-specified actions if defined conditions are fulfilled. +
For example PCW is able to monitor some computing resources (ProActive Nodes) and deploy new resources (scale up) when the monitored resources are overloaded. Another use-case is to notify users with alerts about degradation of some resources. +
In general PCW allows to trigger any action via submitting a workflow to the ProActive Scheduler.

*Definitions:*

Rule:: - defines a monitoring part, triggering conditions and action. Rules generally use a template for certain monitoring use-cases and parameterize this template using variables.
Rule Instance:: - instantiated rule with concrete set of variables. One Rule can have several Rule Instances with different values of variables. The rule instance can be activated/deactivated. When the rule instance is activated, it will start a monitoring defined inside the rule.

=== Monitoring

There are several types of metrics that can be monitored by PCW. Proactive Cloud Watch implements a polling mechanism to collect the monitoring metrics. A delay can also be added to resume monitoring after an action has been triggered only after a certain time. This feature is very useful in case of scale up/down use-cases and helps to avoid triggering extra actions until the new resource is deploying/undeploying. +
The design of PCW allows to add new types of monitoring metrics.

==== Monitoring physical metrics
ProActive provides a way to monitor system metrics of virtual and physical machines (Nodes) deployed by ProActive Resource Manager. +
Thanks to the JMX protocol, Proactive Nodes can expose many system metrics from the underlying operating system (disk, ram, cpu usage, network activity, etc...).
Proactive Nodes use the  https://github.com/hyperic/sigar[Sigar^] library to collect physical metrics. +

ProActive Cloud watch can monitor any ProActive Node JMX url to access the following metrics:

* System memory, swap, cpu, load average, uptime, logins.
* Per-process memory, cpu, credential info, state, arguments, environment, open files.
* File system threshold detection and metrics.
* Network interface detection, configuration information and metrics.
* Network route and connection tables.

==== Monitoring host accessibility
Another type of monitoring available in PCW is to check host accessibility. The implementation of this metric follows the `ping` host approach. With help of this metric a user can easily check if a host is down (or up) and in this case automatically trigger an action.

=== Processing mechanism
The core of rule processing is managed by the https://www.drools.org/[Drools Engine^] for performance processing of collected metrics. It features powerful mechanisms for complex event processing. The advanced Drools algorithm helps fast detection of fulfilling the conditions and triggering actions.

=== Rule’s Action
According to the concepts of PCW, the action will be triggered when specified condition is met. +
In order to make an action flexible to any user needs, the rule’s action is firing a job inside scheduler. A user just need to specify which workflow from Catalog will be fired as Rule’s action. +
For example, a user can design an action workflow that will send notification (alert) if some metric has reached a critical value. +
For scalability use-case a Rule’s action can be staring of the Cloud Automation service that will deploy new resources.
